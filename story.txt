There once was a man walking along the hauptstrasse.
His BMW had broken down a mile away.
He saw a Hund across the hauptstrasse.
The Hund told him to buy a Porsche.
Shocked by what he just witnessed, the man dropped his brot.
Now disappointed, the man had to make the 15 KM trip to Berlin for another one :(
